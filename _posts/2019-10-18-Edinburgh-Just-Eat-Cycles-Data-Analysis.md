My task is to investigate the dataset in the file bikes_October18.csv which contains anonymised data for all trips taken in October 2018 with the Edinburgh Cycle Hire bikes [found here](https://edinburghcyclehire.com/open-data/historical). This dataset is kindly supplied for use by Edinburgh Cycle Hire under the [Open Government License (OGL) v3.0](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/)

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
