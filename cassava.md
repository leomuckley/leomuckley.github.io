## Cassava Leaf Disease Classification

**Overview:** 
Developed a method utilising EfficientNet[] model to accurately classify images of Cassava plants to distinguish between healthy and diseased crops.

### 1. Problem

The Cassava leaf disease classification competition presents 21,367 labeled images, where the majority of the images were crowdsourced from farmers. These images were subsequently annotated by experts at the National Crops Resources Research Institute (NaCRRI) in collaboration with the AI lab at Makerere University, Kampala. As an added challenge, effective solutions for farmers must perform well under significant constraints, since African farmers may only have access to mobile-quality cameras with low-bandwidth. Therefore a successful method will allow farmers to be able to quickly identify diseased plants, potentially saving their crops before they inflict irreparable damage.

The goal of this competition is to classify each cassava image into four disease categories or a fifth category indicating a healthy leaf. The following image contains examples of the various diseased/healthy plants:
